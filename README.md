# Swachh Sagar

## Introduction
Swachh Sagar is a project developed by Sagar Mondal that addresses the growing issue of underwater waste in oceans and seas. The project provides three innovative solutions: 
1. Underwater waste detection using the YoloV8 Algorithm.
2. Aquatic life habitat assessment through a rule-based classifier.
3. Water classification for fitness for drinking or irrigation using a Machine Learning model.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Underwater Waste Detection**: The YoloV8 model is used to detect underwater waste. This model is trained on a dataset of 5000 images.
2. **Aquatic Life Habitat Assessment**: This feature uses a rule-based classifier based on the chemical properties guidelines from the US EPA and WHO.
3. **Water Classification**: A Machine Learning model trained on a dataset with over 6 million rows is used to classify water as fit for drinking, irrigation, or not fit.

## Features
- **Underwater Waste Detection**: Detects various types of waste underwater using advanced computer vision techniques.
- **Aquatic Life Habitat Assessment**: Assesses the suitability of aquatic habitats based on water quality parameters.
- **Water Classification**: Provides reliable classifications of water quality for different uses.

## Configuration
Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and configure the necessary environment variables as per your system requirements.
